# SyntheticLibyanReservoir


## Synposis

Synthetic Libya Case contains a flow simulation deck, geological model and a structural grid for a synthetic analog case to a Libyan onshore oil field. This repository contains all necessary files for flow simulation using 3DSL&reg; software of Streamsim&trade;.


## Contents

[Main 3DSL Simulation Deck](/DataFiles/BaseCase.dat) : Main input for flow simulation.

[Porosity and Permeability File](/IncludeFiles/include/depo.GRDECL) : Depositional model containing porosity & permeability 

[3D Structural Grid](IncludeFiles/include/geometry_large.INC) : 3-D Deformational Grid

[Fault Model](IncludeFiles/include/faults_final.INC) : Representation of structural model within the simulation deck
